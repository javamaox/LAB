<!-- ========== Defined Types ============================================= -->


<!-- An "AttributeName" is the identifier of a page, request, session, or
     application scope attribute.
-->
<!ENTITY % AttributeName "CDATA">


<!-- A "BeanName" is the identifier of a JavaBean, such as a form bean,
     and also serves as the name of the corresponding scripting variable
     and the name of the JSP attribute under which the bean is accessed.
     Therefore, it must conform to the rules for a Java identifier.
-->
<!ENTITY % BeanName "CDATA">


<!-- A "Boolean" is the string representation of a boolean (true or false)
     variable.
-->
<!ENTITY % Boolean "(true|false|yes|no)">

     instantiated to provide the functionality of the enclosing element.
-->
<!ENTITY % ClassName "CDATA">


<!-- An "Integer" is a character string consisting solely of numeric digits,
     optionally preceeded by a minus sign, that can be converted to a
     32-bit integer.
-->
<!ENTITY % Integer "CDATA">


<!-- A "Location" is a relative path, delimited by "/" characters, that
     defines the location of a resource relative to the location of the
     Struts configuration file itself.
-->
<!ENTITY % Location "#PCDATA">


<!-- A "PropName" is the name of a JavaBeans property, and must begin with
     a lower case letter and contain only characters that are legal in a
     Java identifier.
-->
<!ENTITY % PropName "CDATA">


<!-- A "RequestPath" is an module-relative URI path, beginning with a
     slash, that identifies a mapped resource (such as a JSP page or a servlet)

<!-- The name of a JSP bean scope within which such a form bean may be
     accessed.
-->
<!ENTITY % RequestScope "(request|session)">


<!-- ========== Top Level Elements ======================================== -->


<!-- The "struts-config" element is the root of the configuration file
     hierarchy, and contains nested elements for all of the other
     configuration settings.
-->
<!ELEMENT catalogTables (table*)>

<!-- The "data-sources" element describes a set of DataSource objects [JDBC 2.0
     Standard Extension]. The individual DataSource objects are configured through
     nested <data-source> elements.
-->
<!ELEMENT table (id?,tablename?)>
